            The capacity of our facility is constantly growing to accommodate more cattle. Our steel pipe pens, alleyways, head chutes, and vet shack are kept very clean to lower any chance of disease transmission. 
            <br><br>
            We work hard to prevent shrinkage while your cattle are at our facility, by offering hay and automatic waterers. 
            <br><br>
            Water-misters and fans are kept running around the clock during warm weather to keep your cattle calm and cool. We ensure that your livestock is handled and cared for properly when they are with us. You will appreciate the way our employees care for your animals in preparation for the sale.
